* Strings: Operations, formatting (f-strings, format(), etc.)
* File Handling: Reading and writing files using open() and with statements
* Error Handling: try, except, finally

# Advanced

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Python is an object-oriented language. Mastering OOP will help you structure your code effectively.

* Classes: Defining classes using class.
* Inheritance: Subclasses and inheritance hierarchy.
* Polymorphism: Using a single interface to represent different underlying forms.
* Encapsulation: Access modifiers (public, private, protected).
* Abstraction: Using abstract base classes with abc.ABCMeta.

## Advanced Data Structures

Python has built-in modules and libraries that extend its functionality for data manipulation:

* itertools: For efficient looping and iteration.
* datetime: Working with dates, times, and time zones.
* collections: Specialized container datatypes like deque, Counter, etc.

## Functional Programming

Functional programming is a paradigm that emphasizes the use of functions to create programs:

* Lambda Functions: Anonymous functions for simple operations.
* Map and Filter: Using map() and filter() for functional programming.
* List Comprehensions: Concise way to create lists based on existing iterables.

## Modules and Libraries

Python has a vast ecosystem of libraries that you should explore:

* numpy: For numerical computations and arrays.
* pandas: For data manipulation and analysis (e.g., DataFrames).
* matplotlib and seaborn: For data visualization.
* requests: For HTTP requests and APIs.

## Advanced Topics

* Decorators: Functions that modify or extend other functions.
* Generators: Using `yield` to create iterators.
* Context Managers: Using `with` statements for resource management (__enter__ and __exit__ methods).
* Error Handling: Custom `exceptions` and handling specific errors.
* Asynchronous Programming: Using asyncio for non-blocking code.

### decorator

* extend the behavior of a function, without change the actual code of func
* essentially a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a new function with enhanced functionality.
* [example](files/conn.py)

## Practice with Real-World Projects

To solidify your understanding, work on projects that apply Python's advanced features:

* Build a simple web scraper using requests and BeautifulSoup.
* Create a data analysis pipeline using pandas and numpy.
* Implement an asynchronous script to handle I/O-bound tasks.
* Write a small application using OOP principles.

## **1. Build a Strong Foundational Knowledge**

Before diving into advanced topics, ensure you have a solid understanding of Python basics:

- Data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans, None)
- Control flow (if statements, loops)
- Functions
- Lists, tuples, and dictionaries
- File handling
- Error handling

---

## **2. Advanced Topics in Python**
Here are some advanced features you should focus on:

### **a. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

- Classes and objects
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction

**Practice:**
- Create a simple class hierarchy (e.g., Animal → Dog, Cat).
- Implement polymorphic functions.

### **b. Advanced Data Structures**

- **Generators:** Use `yield` to create iterators.
  ```python
  def fibonacci():
      a, b = 0, 1
      while True:
          yield a
          a, b = b, a + b

  for num in fibonacci():
      print(num)
  ```
- **Comprehensions:** Lists, dictionaries, and generators.
  ```python
  # List comprehension
  squares = [x**2 for x in range(6)]

  # Dictionary comprehension
  d = {i: i**2 for i in range(5)}
  ```

### **c. Functional Programming**

- **Lambda Functions:** Short anonymous functions.
  ```python
  add = lambda a, b: a + b
  print(add(3, 4))  # Output: 7
  ```

- **Map and Filter:** Apply functions to iterables.
  ```python
  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  
  # Map squares
  squared = list(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers))
  
  # Filter even numbers
  evens = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
  ```

### **d. Modules and Packages**

- Importing modules:
  ```python
  import math
  from math import sqrt
  ```

- Creating your own packages:
  - Use `__init__.py` to make directories into packages.
  - Organize code into logical modules.

**Practice:**

- Create a simple package with multiple modules.
- Use existing packages like NumPy or Pandas for data manipulation.

### **e. Error Handling**

- Try-except blocks:
  ```python
  try:
      x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
  except ValueError:
      print("That's not a number!")
  ```

### **f. Multithreading and Multiprocessing**

- Use the `threading` module for threads.
- Use the `multiprocessing` module for processes (better for CPU-bound tasks).

  ```python
  import threading

  def worker():
      print(f"Thread {threading.get_ident()} is running")

  thread1 = threading.Thread(target=worker)
  thread2 = threading.Thread(target=worker)
  thread1.start()
  thread2.start()
  ```

### **g. Decorators**

- Enhance functions with decorators:

  ```python
  def my_decorator(func):
      def wrapper():
          print("Something before the function.")
          func()
          print("Something after the function.")
      return wrapper

  @my_decorator
  def say_hello():
      print("Hello!")

  say_hello()  # Output: Something before..., Hello!, Something after...
  ```

### **h. Context Managers**

- Use `with` statements for resource management:

  ```python
  with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
      content = f.read()
  ```

- Create custom context managers:

  ```python
  class MyContextManager:
      def __enter__(self):
          print("Entering the context")
          return self

      def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
          print("Exiting the context")

  with MyContextManager():
      print("Inside the context")
  ```

### **i. Iterators and Generators**

- Implement custom iterators:

  ```python
  class MyIterator:
      def __init__(self, data):
          self.data = data
          self.index = 0

      def __iter__(self):
          return self

      def __next__(self):
          if self.index >= len(self.data):
              raise StopIteration
          value = self.data[self.index]
          self.index += 1
          return value

  my_iter = MyIterator([1, 2, 3])
  for num in my_iter:
      print(num)
  ```

## **3. Advanced Topics and Best Practices**

- **Memory Management:** Learn about references, garbage collection, and `sys.getrefcount()`.
- **Performance Optimization:** Use tools like `cProfile` and `timeit`.
- **Testing:** Write unit tests with `unittest` or `pytest`.
- **Code Style:** Follow PEP 8 guidelines for clean code.

**Practice:**
- Build small projects (e.g., a calculator, to-do list app).
- Contribute to open-source Python projects.
